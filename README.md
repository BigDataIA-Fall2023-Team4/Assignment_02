# Problem Statement:

Our team has been assigned the critical task of developing a tool that allows analysts to load PDF documents from the SEC website and obtain concise summaries. In pursuit of this goal, we are considering the adoption of either the nougat or pypdf libraries to facilitate the PDF document processing. Additionally, we aim to leverage the knowledge we gained from reviewing the Open AI cookbook's Q/A system to construct a similar system based on books 2 and 3 of the Open AI cookbook.

The end goal is to create a comprehensive tool that streamlines the process of extracting summaries from PDF documents obtained from the SEC website. This tool will not only serve analysts but also be capable of facilitating a Q/A system inspired by the Open AI cookbook. By effectively addressing the tasks outlined above, we can design and implement a powerful solution that meets the needs of our users and leverages the latest technologies to enhance document analysis and summarization.
